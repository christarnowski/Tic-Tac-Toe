Tic-Tac-Toe
===========
TicTacToe is yet another implementation of classic `Tic-Tac-Toe <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe>`_
game. The game has been written in `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ in response
to coding "challenge" from `Richard Bronosky <https://github.com/RichardBronosky>`_ and as a fun way to learn Python programming language.

The game features unbeatable rules-based engine and rather slow NegaMax engine.

How to play

Simply run ``main.py`` and enjoy!
